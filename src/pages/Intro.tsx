            This is a sanitation activity reporting digital platform for
            monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on urban sanitation activities,
            helping stakeholders track progress and improve sanitation services
            citywide. This tool facilitates data collection, analysis, and
            visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to

            efforts, enabling informed decision-making, and progress tracking
            towards achieving inclusive and sustainable sanitation for all city
            residents.
